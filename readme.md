## Mock Tests

    These tests assure you really know how to code, it automatically detects code copying and prevents you from passing the test.
    
## Mini-Max Sum

[Code](https://github.com/valentevinicius/hacker-rank/blob/main/minimax.py)

    Given five positive integers, find the minimum and maximum values
    that can be calculated by summing exactly four of the five integers.
    Then print the respective minimum and maximum values as a single line of two space-separated long integers.

    Example:
    arr = [1,3,5,7,9]

    The minimum sum is 1+3+5+7=16
    The maximum sum is 3+5+7+9=24

    The function prints 16 24

## Time conversion

[Code](https://github.com/valentevinicius/hacker-rank/blob/main/timeConversion.py)

    Given a time in 12-hour AM/PM format, convert it to military (24-hour) time.

    Note: - 12:00:00AM on a 12-hour clock is 00:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.
    - 12:00:00PM on a 12-hour clock is 12:00:00 on a 24-hour clock.

    Example

    s = '12:01:00PM'
    return 12:01:00

    s = '12:01:00AM'
    return 00:01:00
